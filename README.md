This is a simple web page that allows users to drag and drop items between two containers.

## Features

- Two containers (Container 1 and Container 2) side by side on the page.
- Items can be dragged from Container 1 to Container 2.

4. To move an item, click and hold the mouse button on an item in Container 1, drag it to Container 2, and release the mouse button to drop it.

5. When an item is dropped into Container 2, a success message will be displayed below Container 2.

6. To reset the interface, click the "Reset" button. Container 2 will be cleared, and Container 1 will be reset to its original state.
